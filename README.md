## A Form Generator\.\.\. All at RUNTIME


</div>

### Description

This isn't meant for anything except for learning (it is meant right now for a scripting language I'm writing). This will generate forms, and keep track of them. you can then change propertys of the different forms, and it is all done at runtime. the next version of this will have controls that are made at runtime and the control's property's will also be able to be changed. it is kind of hard to explain, so download it and check it out. This is meant for learning and doesn't have some special purpose, so pls don't complain. I am also not expecting any votes, so I'm not even gonna ask people to vote, lol.
